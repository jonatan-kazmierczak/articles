# Avoid the mark of the beast and live!

Extremely important and relevant to us book of Revelation says in [14:9-11](https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/14.htm):

> “If anyone **worships the beast and its image and receives its mark on their forehead or on their hand**, they, too, will drink the wine of God’s fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath.  
> They will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever. There will be no rest day or night for those who **worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who receives the mark of its name**.”

How can you avoid this horrible punishment? What does it mean to **receive the mark of the beast** ? Let's find it out.

*Note*: used website with the Bible texts allows to change a language; you would benefit most by reading the text in the language, which you can best understand.

## What is the mark of the beast?
[Revelation 13:15-18](https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/13.htm) says:

> The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. 

> It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to **receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads**, so that they could not buy or sell unless they had **the mark**, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.

> This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666.

### Important points
* *the beast* forces all people, regardless of their status, to receive *the mark*
* people cannot buy or sell unless they have *the mark* - *the name of the beast or the number of its name*

### Explanation
*Note*: the term *centrally controlled*, used below, means controlled within a country, group of countries (i.e. European Union) or worldwide.

* *the beast* is described in details in [Revelation 13](https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/13.htm)
* *the mark on the right hand or on the forehead* represents service - person having *the mark* makes a choice to serve *the beast*;  
the contrary is mentioned in [Revelation 7:3](https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/7.htm):

> “Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put *a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God*.” 

* person without *the mark of the beast* faces difficulties - with buying, selling, getting and keeping the job or travelling to other countries

Some of the current aspects of *the mark of the beast* are:

1. centrally controlled and monitored transaction / payment solutions (often the only accepted ones):
   * dedicated mobile phone applications
   * payment cards: credit / debit
1. centrally controlled and monitored vaccination certificates / passports (more and more often required to get / keep the job, to travel to other country, to join an event, etc.)

## Summary
Even if you have *the mark of the beast*, you can still get rid of it.  
It's worth of every effort; [Revelation 20:4-6](https://biblehub.com/nkjv/revelation/20.htm) says:

> And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was committed to them. Then I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, who had **not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands**. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.  
> But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished.  
> This is the first resurrection.   
> Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.
