> They will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever. There will be no rest day or night for those who **worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who receives the mark of its name**.”

## What is the mark of the beast?
[Revelation 13:15-18](https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/13.htm) says:

> The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. 

> It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to **receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads**, so that they could not buy or sell unless they had **the mark**, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.

> This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666.

* *the mark on the right hand or on the forehead* represents service and support - person having *the mark* makes a choice to serve or to support *the beast* - by thoughts, words or actions;  
the contrary is mentioned in [Revelation 7:3](https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/7.htm):

> “Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put *a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God*.”

You should do it as quickly as possible in order to avoid the horrible punishment mentioned on the beginning.  
It's worth of every effort; [Revelation 20:4-6](https://biblehub.com/nkjv/revelation/20.htm) says:

> And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was committed to them. Then I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, who had **not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands**. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.  
> But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished.  
> This is the first resurrection.   
> Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.
