# Kingdom of God - the only solution to the current problems of the world

## Which problems of the world cannot be successfully eliminated?
Some of the biggest problems of the world include:

- sicknesses and death
- violence (including wars and uprisings)
- criminality (including cyber-criminality)
- poverty
- corruption of moral and ethical standards
- natural disasters
- devastation of the environment

Some additional problems include:

- unavailability of clean, drinkable water or food items/products
- homelessness
- refugees

Since long time people are putting much effort to eliminate only a part of the mentioned problems, but without success.  
If people cannot solve those problems, what is the solution? **The Kingdom of God**

## What is the Kingdom of God?
It is an eternal, righteous rulership of God over the earth (all people and resources), coming from heaven, replacing all existing man-made governments and solutions.  
It will successfully solve all problems mentioned above.

## Where can I find information about the Kingdom of God?
You can find them in [the Bible](https://biblehub.com/isv/).  
It is enough to read [the Gospel of Luke](https://biblehub.com/isv/luke) and [the Book of Genesis](https://biblehub.com/isv/genesis) to learn minimal required information.

However I can recommend reading the following Bible books in the given order in the language which you know best:

Few suggestions:

- you can find a Bible text in other languages i.e. [here](https://biblehub.com/bibles/luke/1-1.htm), in section *Multilingual Translations*
- if a given fragment is boring for you, skip it and move forward
- if you don't understand some fragment, just move forward - it happens to everyone; you can read that fragment again later to understand it better

## What to do with the information you have learned?
- repent of your sins
- pray for the Kingdom of God to come
- share the information with whomever you can
