# Will the Coronavirus disease pandemic last over 3.5 years?

Unusual worldwide situation which started in year 2020, officially called *[Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019)*, will very likely last over 3.5 years.  
Why so long?
Because this situation seems to be the fulfillment of a very important prophecy given over 2,500 years ago to Daniel - a respected Jew living in Persian empire.

## The prophecy
The Book of Daniel, [chapter 12](https://www.sefaria.org/Daniel.12?lang=bi), verses [11](https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-11.htm) and [12](https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-12.htm), say:
> From the time  
> the regular [offering] is abolished,  
> and an appalling abomination is set up  
> â€” it will be a 1,290 days. 

> Happy the one who waits and reaches 1,335 days.

## Explanation

### *the regular [offering] is abolished*
other possible meanings:
- *the regular [offering]*:  
  continuity, regularity  
  *Note*: the word *offering* does not occur in the original Hebrew text, but is added by translators
- *abolished*:  
  removed, departed, turned aside, taken away

Since year 2020 the regularity and continuity of life of most people in the world is taken away.  
Examples:
- people don't meet personally
  - even with their own parents/children and close family members
  - even on very important occasions such as worshipping of God or funeral
- schools and other places are closed (including places of worship of God)
- very limited possibilities of travelling to other locations (countries, states, regions)
- no cultural events, i.e. cinema film projections, artistic performances and shows
- no big sport events, i.e. Olympics, international championships
- people are imprisoned in their own homes (so-called *lockdown*)

### *an appalling abomination is set up*
other possible meanings:
- *appalling*:  
  desolating, ruining
- *abomination*:  
  detestable thing, detestable idol

In year 2020 an appalling, ruining and desolating abomination (or detestable thing or detestable idol) was set up.
It is officially called *Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic*.  
Examples:
- healthy people are scared of personal contact or shaking hands with other healthy people
- local and global economy is being ruined
  - businesses are closed most part of the year, hence cannot bring profit, must release the stuff and finally collapse
  - people cannot work or are not allowed to work
- hotels and touristic places are empty and desolate

Why is it an abomination / detestable thing / detestable idol:
- *Coronavirus* is the topic
  - mentioned in every news
  - to which people sacrifice a lot of their time, by reading, hearing and speaking about it
  - which superseded all other topics, including topic of God and Jesus Christ
- people believe in being freed from *Coronavirus* (and other sicknesses) by medical and pharmaceutical systems, rather than by God and Jesus Christ
- faces and face expressions of people cannot be seen because faces are continuously covered by masks

Worth to mention, that [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/) and many other medical institutions and pharmaceutical businesses, strongly connected with the topic of *Coronavirus*, use an ancient idol as their symbol - a snake on a pole
(for more info, please see in the Bible: [2 Kings 18:4](https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm), [Numbers 21:8-9](https://biblehub.com/niv/numbers/21.htm), [Revelation 12:9](https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm))

### *there will be 1,290 days*
The unusual worldwide situation, described above, should last 1,290 days - it means 3 years and 7 months (counting 30 days as 1 month).

However, it is important for you to successfully reach the end of 1,335 days - it means 1.5 month in addition.

## Context
Some additional info about the context of the referred prophecy:
- it was given to a respected Jew called Daniel, living in the Persian empire at that time, *in the third year of the reign of King Cyrus of Persia* - it means over 2,500 years ago (see [Daniel 10:1](https://biblehub.com/niv/daniel/10.htm))
- it was finally delivered by an angel, who was stopped on the way for 21 days by *the prince of the Persian kingdom* - an invisible ruler of the Persian empire; this is the only recorded case of a wicked force blocking delivery of a prophecy - it means, that the prophecy contains extremely important information
(see [Daniel 10](https://biblehub.com/niv/daniel/10.htm))
- the whole prophecy is written in the Book of Daniel, chapters [11](https://biblehub.com/niv/daniel/11.htm) (our present times described since verse 40) and [12](https://biblehub.com/niv/daniel/12.htm) (referring to our present times and the future)
- additional info about this and other relevant prophecies can be found in the article [What should you expect in the near future?](./near-future.md#what-should-you-expect-in-the-near-future)

## What should you do?
- apply to your life [Psalm 40](https://biblehub.com/niv/psalms/40.htm)
- stay safe and encouraged by [Psalm 91](https://biblehub.com/niv/psalms/91.htm)
