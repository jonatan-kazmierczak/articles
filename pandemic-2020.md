# Will the Coronavirus disease pandemic last over 3.5 years ?

Unusual worldwide situation which started in year 2020, called *[Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019)*, will very likely last over 3.5 years. It includes:
* taking away known regularity of life
* devastation of the world economy

This situation is most likely the fulfillment of very important prophecy written in the Bible, in the Book of Daniel.

## The prophecy
The Book of Daniel, [chapter 12](https://biblehub.com/niv/daniel/12.htm), verses [11](https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-11.htm) (including all alternative translations) and [12](https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-12.htm), say:
> And from the time the  
> continuance / constant / ellipt / regular / sacrifice  
> is  
> taken away / turned aside  
> and the  
> desolating / stunning / devastating / stupefying  
> abomination / disgusting / filthy / idolatrous / idol  
> is set up  
> there will be 1,290 days.  

> Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1,335 days.  

## Explanation

### *continuance/constant/regularity  is  taken away / turned aside*
Since year 2020 the regularity/continuance/constant of life of most people in the world is taken away.
Examples:
- people don't shake hands nor embrace each other
- people don't meet personally - even with own parents/children and close family members and even on such important occasions as funeral
- no travelling to other locations
- no cultural events, i.e. cinema film projections, artistic performances and shows
- no big sport events, i.e. olympics, international championships
- schools and other places are closed
- people are imprisoned in own houses (so-called *lockdown*)

### *desolating/devastating/stupefying/stunning  abomination/disgusting/filthy/idolatrous/idol  is set up*
Since year 2020:
- cities and towns are turned into empty places with closed businesses and without people on the streets
- hotels and touristic places are empty and desolated
- local and global economy is continuously being devastated
  - businesses are closed during most of the year, cannot bring profit, must release the stuff and finally collapse
  - people cannot or are not allowed to work
- people avoid personal contact with close family members and friends
- healthy people believe, that personal contact or shaking hands with other healthy person is dangerous

In addition, since year 2020:
- *Corona* and *Covid-19*, mentioned much more frequently than *God* and *Jesus Christ*, are part of the idolatry
- people believe in being saved from the pandemic (and other sicknesses) by medical and pharmaceutical systems, rather than by God and Jesus Christ - this is also idolatry

Worth to mention, that [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/) and many other medical institutions and pharmaceutical businesses, worshipped by people since year 2020, use an ancient idol as their symbol - a snake on a pole
(for more info, please see in the Bible: [2 Kings 18:4](https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm), [Numbers 21:8-9](https://biblehub.com/niv/numbers/21.htm), [Revelation 12:9](https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm))

### *there will be 1,290 days*
The unusual worldwide realities, mentioned above, will last 1,290 days - it means 3 years and 7 months (counting 30 days as 1 month).

However, it is important to successfully reach the end of 1,335 days - it means 1.5 month more.

## Context
Some additional info about the context of the referred prophecy:
- it was given to a Jew called Daniel, living at that time in Persian empire, *in the third year of the reign of King Cyrus of Persia* - it means over 2,500 years ago (see [Daniel 10:1](https://biblehub.com/niv/daniel/10.htm))
- it was finally delivered by an angel, who was stopped on the way for 21 days by *the prince of the Persian kingdom* - an invisible ruler of Persian empire; this is the only recorded case about a wicked force blocking delivery of a prophecy - it means, that the prophecy include extremely important information
(see [Daniel 10](https://biblehub.com/niv/daniel/10.htm))
- the whole prophecy is written in the Book of Daniel, chapters [11](https://biblehub.com/niv/daniel/11.htm) (our times described since verse 40) and [12](https://biblehub.com/niv/daniel/12.htm) (our times and the future)
- additional info about this and other relevant prophecies can be found in the article [What should you expect in the near future?](./near-future.md#what-should-you-expect-in-the-near-future)

## What should you do?
- apply to your life [Psalm 40](https://biblehub.com/niv/psalms/40.htm)
- stay safe, encouraged by [Psalm 91](https://biblehub.com/niv/psalms/91.htm)
