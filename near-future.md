## Explanation

### Ride of the Death
The prophesy given by God, written in the book of [Revelation, chapter 6](https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/6.htm) says:

*(verses 7-8)*
> When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!”
> I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.  

### Time of great tribulation and distress
The prophesy of Jesus Christ, written in the gospel of [Matthew, chapter 24](https://biblehub.com/nkjv/matthew/24.htm) says:

*(verses 7-8)*
> For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in various places.  
> All these [are] the beginning of sorrows.

*(verses 21-22)*
> For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be. 
> And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect’s sake those days will be shortened.

The prophesy quoted above extends the older prophesy about *time of the end*, given by God through his angel, written in the book of [Daniel, chapter 12](https://biblehub.com/niv/daniel/12.htm):

*(verse 1)*
> At that time Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. But at that time your people — everyone whose name is found written in the book — will be delivered.  

*(verses 8-10)*
> I heard, but I did not understand. So I asked, “My lord, what will the outcome of all this be?”  
> He replied, “Go your way, Daniel, because the words are rolled up and sealed until the time of the end.
> Many will be purified, made spotless and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. None of the wicked will understand, but those who are wise will understand.  

*([verse 11](https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-11.htm) - discussed in details in a [separate article](./pandemic-2020.md#will-the-coronavirus-disease-pandemic-last-over-35-years))*
> And from the time [that] the daily [sacrifice] is taken away, and the abomination of desolation is set up, [there shall be] 1,290 days.

*(verse 12)*
> Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1,335 days.  

### Happy future for righteous people
All prophesies referenced above have happy continuation.

The angel added:  
*([Daniel 12:2-3](https://biblehub.com/niv/daniel/12.htm))*
> Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt.
> Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever.  

Jesus Christ confirmed it, saying about wicked people:  
*([Matthew 25:46](https://biblehub.com/niv/matthew/25.htm))*
> Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.  

The prophesy written in the book of Revelation continues:  
*([chapter 21](https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/21.htm), verses 3-8)*
> And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.  
> ‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”  

> He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making everything new!” Then he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.”  

> He said to me: “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life.  
> Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children.  
> But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.”

*([chapter 22](https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/22.htm), verse 2)*
> On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month.  
> And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.
