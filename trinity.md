# Trinity - teaching of the Bible?

I have noticed, that some people believe, that the true God is a *trinity*.  
As a basis of the believe they quote [Matthew 28:18-20](https://biblehub.com/niv/matthew/28.htm):  
> Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 
> Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 
> and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

## How many true Gods are mentioned in the Bible? Are they equal?

Apostle John wrote in [chapter 1, verse 18](https://biblehub.com/niv/john/1.htm) about Jesus Christ:
> No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known.

Jesus Christ said, as written in [John 14:28-31](https://biblehub.com/niv/john/14.htm):
> "You heard me say, ‘I am going away and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.
> (...)
> I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me."

## How do we, people, proof that there are 2 true Gods?

*([Genesis 1:26-27](https://biblehub.com/nlt/genesis/1.htm))*
> Then God said, “Let us make human beings in our image, to be like us. (...)”  
> So God created human beings in his own image. In the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.

Look at yourself now. How many eyes and ears do you have? How many hands and legs?  
Have you noticed number 3 present anywhere in your body?

## Has anyone seen the Holy Spirit together with the God and Jesus?

*([Acts 7:55-56](https://biblehub.com/niv/acts/7.htm))*
> But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. 
> “Look,” he said, “I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.”

## What is the Holy Spirit?

John the Baptist said about Jesus Christ, as written in [Luke 3:16](https://biblehub.com/luke/3-16.htm):
> John answered them all, "I baptize you with water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."

Please look at the meanings of the word *spirit*: wind, breath, spirit.  
Do you believe, that wind and fire have personalities?
