# Trinity - teaching of the Bible?

I have noticed, that some people believe, that the true God is a *trinity*.  
As a basis of the believe they quote [Matthew 28:18-20](https://biblehub.com/niv/matthew/28.htm):  
> Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 
> Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 
> and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

Let's take a closer look at the Bible teachings.

## How many true Gods are mentioned in the Bible? Are they equal?

The gospel of [John 1:18](https://biblehub.com/niv/john/1.htm) says about Jesus Christ:
> No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known.

Jesus Christ said to his disciples, as it is written in [John 14:28-31](https://biblehub.com/niv/john/14.htm):
> "You heard me say, ‘I am going away and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.
> (...)
> I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me."

Jesus Christ prayed to His Father, as recorded in
[Matthew 26:39,42](https://biblehub.com/niv/matthew/26.htm) ,
[Luke 22:41-44](https://biblehub.com/niv/luke/22.htm) ,
[Mark 14:35-36](https://biblehub.com/niv/mark/14.htm) :
> Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.”  
> He went away a second time and prayed, “My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.”


## How do we, people, proof that there are 2 true Gods?

*([Genesis 1:26-27](https://biblehub.com/nlt/genesis/1.htm))*
> Then God said, “Let us make human beings in our image, to be like us. (...)”  
> So God created human beings in his own image. In the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.

Look at yourself now. How many eyes and ears do you have? How many hands and legs?  
And how many genders do you know? Also 2: male and female.  
Can you find number 3 in your body?

## What is spirit / wind?
In the original Bible text, there are 2 words, which are sometimes translated as *spirit*, sometimes as *wind*, sometimes yet differently:

- Hebrew word *[רוּחַ (ruah)](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/7307.htm)*
  (please see [occurrences and different translations](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/strongs_7307.htm))
- Greek word *[πνεῦμα (pneuma)](https://biblehub.com/greek/4151.htm)*
  (please see [occurrences and different translations](https://biblehub.com/greek/strongs_4151.htm))

Translators and interpreters decide, how to translate the word and how to write it (starting from a small letter or from a capital letter).  
Please look at some examples, which are translated differently in various Bible translations (sometimes as *wind*, sometimes as *spirit*):

- [John 3:8](https://biblehub.com/john/3-8.htm) - what is blowing: wind or spirit?
- [Hebrew 1:7](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-7.htm) - spirits or winds?
- [Psalm 104:4](https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-4.htm) - spirits or winds? (in addition: angels or messengers?)

## What is the Holy Spirit (or holy wind)?

*([Luke 1:13-15](https://biblehub.com/niv/luke/1.htm))*:
> But the angel said to him: "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John.
> (...) He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born."

Reaction of Elizabeth to the visit of Mary (Elizabeth had no idea, that Mary had very early pregnancy - she was bearing Jesus Christ), as it is writen in
[Luke 1:41-45](https://biblehub.com/niv/luke/1.htm):
> When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. 
> In a loud voice she exclaimed: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! 
> But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
> As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. 
> Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!”

*([Luke 1:67](https://biblehub.com/niv/luke/1.htm))*:
> His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied

*([Acts 7:55-56](https://biblehub.com/niv/acts/7.htm))*
> But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. 
> “Look,” he said, “I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.”

Jesus Christ said, as it is written in [Luke 11:13](https://biblehub.com/niv/luke/11.htm)
> "If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!"

## Occurrence of the number 3 in the Bible

*([Revelation 16:13](https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/16.htm))*
> Then I saw 3 impure spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
