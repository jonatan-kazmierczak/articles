# Trinity - teaching of the Bible?

I have noticed, that some people believe, that the true God is a *trinity*.  
As a basis of the belief they quote [Matthew 28:18-20](https://biblehub.com/niv/matthew/28.htm):  
> Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 
> Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 
> and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

Let's take a closer look at the Bible teachings.

## How many true Gods are mentioned in the Bible?

2nd letter of Peter starts with [words](https://biblehub.com/niv/2_peter/1.htm):
> Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours:  
> Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.

The gospel of John says in [chapter 1](https://biblehub.com/niv/john/1.htm) says about Jesus Christ:  
*(verse 1)*
> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

*(verse 18)*
> No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known.

The Bible starts with [the statement](https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm):
> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

Letter to [Hebrews 1:8-10](https://biblehub.com/gwt/hebrews/1.htm) says:
> But God said about his Son, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter in your kingdom is a scepter for justice. (...)"  
> God also said, "Lord, in the beginning you laid the foundation of the earth. With your own hands you made the heavens."

YHWH (Yahweh/Jehovah) says, as written in [Isaiah 48:12-13](https://biblehub.com/niv/isaiah/48.htm):
> "Listen to me, Jacob, Israel, whom I have called: I am he;  
> I am the First and I am the Last.  
> My own hand laid the foundations of the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens;  when I summon them, they all stand up together."

Then we read in [Revelation 1:8](https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/1.htm):
> "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty."

Then Jesus Christ says, as written in [Revelation 1:17-18](https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/1.htm):
> "I am the First and the Last.  
> I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever!"

Then we read in [Revelation 21:6-7](https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/21.htm):
> "It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End.  
> To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life.
> Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children."

Then Jesus Christ says, as written in [Revelation 22:13](https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/22.htm):
> "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End."

## How do we, people, proof that there are 2 true Gods?

*([Genesis 1:26-27](https://biblehub.com/nlt/genesis/1.htm))*
> Then God said, “Let us make human beings in our image, to be like us. (...)”  
> So God created human beings in his own image. In the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.

Look at yourself now. How many eyes and ears do you have? How many hands and legs?  
And how many genders do you know? Also 2: male and female.  

## Is the Son equal to the Father?
Jesus Christ said to his disciples, as it is written in [John 14:28-31](https://biblehub.com/niv/john/14.htm):
> "You heard me say, ‘I am going away and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.
> (...)
> I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me."

Jesus Christ prayed to His Father, as recorded in
[Matthew 26:39,42](https://biblehub.com/niv/matthew/26.htm) ,
[Luke 22:41-44](https://biblehub.com/niv/luke/22.htm) ,
[Mark 14:35-36](https://biblehub.com/niv/mark/14.htm) :
> Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.”  
> He went away a second time and prayed, “My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.”

Letter to [Hebrews chapter 1](https://biblehub.com/niv/hebrews/1.htm) provides very good and complete explanation of the topic.

## What is spirit / wind?
In the original Bible text, there are 2 words (always written from the small letter), which are sometimes translated as *spirit*, sometimes as *wind*, sometimes yet differently:

- Hebrew word *[רוּחַ (ruah)](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/7307.htm)*
  (you can check [occurrences and different translations](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/strongs_7307.htm))
- Greek word *[πνεῦμα (pneuma)](https://biblehub.com/greek/4151.htm)*
  (you can check [occurrences and different translations](https://biblehub.com/greek/strongs_4151.htm))

Translators and interpreters decide, how to translate the word and how to write it (starting from a small letter or from a capital letter).  
Please look at some examples, which are translated differently in various Bible translations (sometimes as *wind*, sometimes as *spirit*):

- [Hebrews 1:7](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-7.htm) - spirits or winds?
- [Psalm 104:4](https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-4.htm) - spirits or winds? (in addition: angels or messengers?)

## What is the Holy Spirit (or holy wind)?

*([Luke 1:13-15](https://biblehub.com/niv/luke/1.htm))*:
> But the angel said to him: "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John.
> (...) He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born."

Reaction of Elizabeth to the visit of Mary (Elizabeth had no idea, that Mary had very early pregnancy - she was bearing Jesus Christ), as it is writen in
[Luke 1:41-45](https://biblehub.com/niv/luke/1.htm):
> When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. 
> In a loud voice she exclaimed: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! 
> But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
> As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. 
> Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!”

*([Luke 1:67](https://biblehub.com/niv/luke/1.htm))*:
> His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied.

*([Acts 7:55-56](https://biblehub.com/niv/acts/7.htm))*
> But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. 
> “Look,” he said, “I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.”

Jesus Christ said, as it is written in [Luke 11:13](https://biblehub.com/niv/luke/11.htm)
> "If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!"

## Trinity mentioned in the Bible

*([Revelation 16:13](https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/16.htm))*
> Then I saw 3 impure spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
