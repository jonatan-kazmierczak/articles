# Avoid the beast, its image and ist mark and live!

> A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: “If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives its mark on their forehead or on their hand, they, too, will drink the wine of God’s fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. They will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever. There will be no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who receives the mark of its name.”

that's written in extremely important and relevant to us book of [Revelation 14:9-11](https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/14.htm).

## What is the dragon and the beast?
[Revelation 13:1-9,18](https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/13.htm) says:

> The dragon stood on the shore of the sea.  
> And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had 10 horns and 7 heads, with 10 crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name.  
> The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion.  
> The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority.  
> One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed.  
> The whole world was filled with wonder and followed the beast.  
> People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, “Who is like the beast? Who can wage war against it?”  
> The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise its authority for 42 months.  
> It opened its mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven.  
> It was given power to wage war against God’s holy people and to conquer them.  
> And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation.  
> All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast — all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world.  

> Whoever has ears, let them hear.

> This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666.
